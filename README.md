ðŸŽ¬ Movie Rental Store Analysis
This project offers a deep-dive analytical exploration of a fictional Movie Rental Store using Power BI, SQL, and data modeling techniques. The objective is to extract actionable insights that can help businesses understand customer behavior, revenue drivers, and film performance to make informed strategic decisions.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The dataset includes tables such as films, actors, customers, rentals, payments, and inventory, providing a solid foundation for relational analysis. The project begins with designing a complete ER (Entity Relationship) Diagram to model and define the data structure, ensuring clean joins and efficient queries throughout the analysis.

Once the model is established, data is loaded and transformed using Power Query. Analytical measures and KPIs are then built using DAX to power the dashboards.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
Actor Performance: Identified top revenue-generating actors like KENNETH and PENELOPE, both generating over 6.7K in revenue.

Customer Insights: Found that only 2.5% of customers are active renters, revealing a strong opportunity to improve engagement.

Geographic Analysis: India emerged as the top country in revenue generation, followed by China and the USA.

Revenue Trends: Highest monthly revenue observed in July 2005 (28.3K), with Sports and Sci-Fi films contributing the most.

Film Category Breakdown: PG-13 and Action films dominated in rentals and inventory stock.

Top Rentals: Highlighted the most-rented films and their impact on overall store performance.
